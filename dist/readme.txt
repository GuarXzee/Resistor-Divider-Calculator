Voltage Divider Calculator
--------------------------

This tool calculates the resistor divider network for a given target output voltage.

How to use:
1. Run "ResistorDivider.exe".
2. Enter:
   - Vup (top voltage)
   - Vdn (bottom voltage, default = 0)
   - Desired Vout (target output voltage)
3. Click "Calculate".
4. The program will display the best matching resistor pairs and draw the circuit.

CSV Files:
- resistors.csv → Input file with a list of resistor values you want to allow in calculations.
- resistor_pairs.csv → Automatically generated by the program at startup. 
                       It stores all unique resistor + parallel combinations.

Note:
- Keep resistors.csv in the same folder as the exe.
- Do not edit resistor_pairs.csv manually; it is recreated each time.

Requirements:
- None. This is a standalone exe (no Python needed).

Enjoy!
